-- such figure, so they are fitted from base liability per acre via a per-(crop, band) ratio

-- built from both). Nothing here is a blind national average silently applied locally.

-- with no national sales at all get no row. crop = '(all crops)' is the rollup, summed over

-- DRP (Dairy Revenue Protection, plan code 83, ADM commodity 0830 "Milk").
--
-- GRAIN, verified against the ADM and NOT what a county-level product looks like: DRP is
-- offered STATEWIDE. Every plan-83 row in ADM A00030 Insurance Offer carries County Code
-- '998' (all counties), so the offer grain is state x quarter x pricing option and there is
-- deliberately no drp_county table — drp_state carries availability instead. RY2026 has
-- exactly 800 plan-83 offers = 50 states x 8 quarters x 2 pricing options, and the fact
-- sheet agrees ("Dairy-RP is available in all counties in all 50 states").
--
-- THERE IS NO PUBLISHED DRP PREMIUM RATE TABLE, so there is no drp_rate table. DRP premium
-- is not a rate lookup: RMA's M13 exhibit P18-1 (Plan 83, Premium Calculation) specifies a
-- 5,000-iteration Monte Carlo over lognormal price draws, i.e.
--     SimulatedLossAverage = ROUND(MAX(SUM(SimulatedLoss[seq]) / 5000.00,
--                                      0.02 * DeclaredCoveredMilkProduction / 100.00), 2)
--     TotalPremiumAmount   = ROUND(ROUND(SimulatedLossAverage * DeclaredShare
--                                        * ProtectionFactor, 0) * LoadingFactor, 0)
-- (Units: every revenue formula divides DeclaredCoveredMilkProduction by 100 against a
-- $/cwt price, and drp_milk_yield is pounds per cow — so declared production is POUNDS.
-- A worked end-to-end run of the above on RY2026 WI 2026Q4 Class pricing at 90% coverage,
-- PF 1.00, 50/50 Class III/IV came out at $0.227/cwt producer premium: the right order of
-- magnitude for real DRP, which is the plausibility check this schema is built to support.)
-- Every INPUT to that simulation is public, and the tables below are exactly those inputs:
-- drp_daily_price (expected prices + sigmas + loading factor), drp_draw (RMA's fixed
-- uniform draws, which AIPs must use verbatim), drp_milk_yield, drp_fmmo_factor,
-- drp_subsidy. So premium is reproducible, just not lookup-able.

-- One row per sales date x offer, so ~450 rows/day (50 states x 5 nearby quarters x 1-2
-- pricing options; the far-out quarters offer Class pricing only, because the butter/cheese/
-- whey/NFDM futures strips do not extend far enough for Component pricing).
-- Class-priced rows populate class3/class4 and leave the component columns NULL, and
-- Component-priced rows do the reverse — that is RMA's encoding, not missing data.
-- The *_restricted columns are RMA's constraint on the producer's declared weighting factor:
-- when non-NULL the declared factor MUST equal it (1 = only Class III / only protein+other
-- solids is published; 0 = only Class IV / only nonfat solids).
-- The DRP sales window, verified 2026-08-07 against RMA primary sources:
--   POST  RMA validates and publishes each day's coverage prices and rates "by 4:30pm CST"
--         (DRP fact sheet, June 2025); if they "are not available on the RMA website by
--         4:30pm, then Dairy-RP will not be offered for sale for the insurance period."
--         The Basic Provisions fix no clock time for posting — only this 4:30 PM CT deadline
--         is documented, so treat 4:30 PM CT as a not-later-than, not a typical arrival.
--   CLOSE 9:00 AM Central Time. 26-DRP Basic Provisions, s.1 Definitions, "Sales period":
--         "The period of time that begins when a daily set of coverage prices and rates are
--         posted on RMA's website and ends at 9:00 AM Central Time the earlier of Sunday or
--         the following business day in which you can purchase quarterly endorsements."
--         Same wording in DRP handbook FCIC-20400U p.6 s.23.B(2)-(3). Unchanged since
--         19-DRP (RY2019, DRP's first year); the only amendment was June 2020, which added
--         the "earlier of Sunday" weekend clause. So this holds for every RY in this table.
-- CAUTION: 9:00 AM CT is DRP's own close and is CORRECT. It is NOT the same as LRP's 8:25 AM

-- ===========================================================================
-- BASIS RISK (area-triggered endorsements: SCO, ECO, MCO, STAX)
-- ===========================================================================

-- NASS Quick Stats yield history, LOCAL ONLY. This is the raw input to the basis-risk
-- estimator and is the exact analogue of prf_grid_index / drp_daily_price: ~1M rows the
-- app never queries. build_app_db.py MUST drop it (see docs/basis_risk.md).
--
-- Four aggregation levels are loaded, not one. COUNTY is the series SCO/ECO settle on;
-- AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT / STATE / NATIONAL are there because the basis-risk model needs
-- one parameter it cannot read off a county series (the farm/county variance ratio), and
-- the way yield variance falls as you aggregate county -> district -> state -> national
-- is the only public, data-driven handle on it (src/basisrisk.py: aggregation_scaling).
--
-- Grain is NASS's own: a yield series is identified by crop x class x production practice
-- x unit, and all of those matter. Wheat has no single national series (WINTER vs SPRING
-- vs DURUM); corn splits GRAIN from SILAGE; the Plains split NON-IRRIGATED into CONTINUOUS
-- CROP vs FOLLOWING SUMMER FALLOW, which is an RMA practice split too. Nothing is
-- collapsed here -- the choice of which series represents a county is made downstream and
-- recorded in basis_risk_county.class_used / practice_used.
--
-- unit: 'BU / ACRE' is yield per HARVESTED acre; 'BU / NET PLANTED ACRE' includes
-- abandonment and therefore carries the deeper downside tail. Both load; the harvested
-- series is the default because it has far more county-years, and the planted series is
-- the robustness check.
-- AREA HARVESTED rides in the same table as YIELD (the `stat` column separates them) because
-- the aggregation-scaling calibration needs the ACRES behind each reporting unit, not a proxy
-- for it: the farm/county variance ratio the model needs is a ratio of AREAS, and a county's
-- planted acreage varies by more than an order of magnitude across the country.
