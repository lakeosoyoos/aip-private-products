"""PRF bulk data path: whole-country indices + rates from RMA's published FILES.

Replaces the per-grid PrfWebApi calls of src/prfdata.py for nationwide work.  The API path
needs ~6 HTTP round-trips per grid (1 index + 1 location + 5 rate calls); at 13,626 CONUS
grids that is ~82,000 requests.  RMA publishes the same numbers in bulk, so this module
gets the entire country from ONE 56 MB download plus ADM members already on disk.

TWO SOURCES
-----------
1. RAINFALL INDEX HISTORY -- one zip, refreshed by RMA each crop year:

     https://pubfs-rma.fpac.usda.gov/pub/Miscellaneous_Files/VI_RI_Data/
         Rainfall_Index_HistoricData2026CY.zip        (~56 MB -> 342 MB text)

   Pipe-delimited, one header line then 11,865,777 data rows:

     grid_id|InsurancePlanCode|Commodity0088|Commodity1191|Year|PracticeCode|ActualIndex
     10020|13|1|1|1948|625|0.755

   Commodity0088 = 1 marks the row as belonging to PRF (0088 Pasture/Rangeland/Forage);
   Commodity1191 is the Annual Forage plan that shares the same grid indices.  Despite its
   name the PracticeCode column carries the ADM A00480 INTERVAL code -- 625 = JAN-FEB
   through 635 = NOV-DEC, sequential -- which is exactly prfdata.INTERVALS.  Years run
   1948..2024 for all 14,469 grids (13,626 CONUS integer ids + 843 Hawaii 'H####' ids on a
   separate grid system, which this loader skips).  This vintage is the CANONICAL ranking
   input: every grid is scored against one internally consistent index release rather than
   whatever the API happened to serve on the day that grid was fetched.

2. PREMIUM RATES + GRID->COUNTY -- the cached ADM chain under data/cache/adm/ (no network
   when the members are already there).  Verified field-for-field against the API for grid
   27663, all 5 coverage levels x 11 intervals:

     A00810 Price rc03   PRF price rows.  Field 10 "Sub County Code" is the PRF grid id;
                         fields 8/9 give State/County Code; fields 21/22/24 the Intended
                         Use / Irrigation / Organic practice codes; field 25 the interval
                         code; field 3 the ADM Insurance Offer ID.
     A01130 AreaCoverageLevel rc05   (offer id x sub county code x coverage level) ->
                         Area Rate ID, coverage type 'A' (additional; 'C' is CAT).
     A01135 AreaRate     Area Rate ID -> Base Rate == the API's PremiumRate.

   THE OFFER IS COUNTY-GRAIN, NOT GRID-GRAIN.  One ADM Insurance Offer ID covers a whole
   county x intended use x interval; A00810 repeats it once per grid in that county, and
   A01130 breaks it back out per grid in its Sub County Code column.  So the offer supplies
   the (use, interval) of a rate and A01130's SUB COUNTY CODE supplies the GRID -- reading
   the grid off the A00810 row instead would smear one grid's rate across every grid in the
   county.  A grid that straddles a county line is reachable through either county's offer;
   the rate is a property of the grid, so those collapse onto one prf_grid_rate row and a
   running sample check MEASURES any county-to-county disagreement instead of assuming it away.

CHANGE DETECTION
----------------
window_hash() fingerprints a grid's 2006-2024 index window; changed_grids() diffs those
fingerprints against prf_index_hash.  RMA revises the index history as gauge data is
finalized, but only a handful of grids move in a given month -- so the monthly job can
re-score the movers instead of all 13,626 grids (see scripts/monthly_update.sh).

POLITENESS: exactly one network call (the zip), skipped entirely once cached.  The ADM
members are read from disk and never re-fetched here.
