"""Self-contained PRF product page — one map, five metrics.

PRF = Pasture, Rangeland, Forage (rainfall index, plan code 13). This module is
the single PRF view in the app: the tab bar is PRODUCT-oriented, so the former
"PRF" (County Base Value) and "PRF Optimizer" tabs are folded into one page with
a metric dropdown.

THE FIVE METRICS
    cbv   County multiplier — County Base Value ($/acre)   [prf_county]
    win   Best win rate (%)                                [prf_opt_best]
    net   Best return per $1 of protection ($)             [prf_opt_best]
    acre  Best return per ACRE ($) — COMPUTED, see below   [both tables]
    comm  Commission per acre ($) — COMPUTED, see below    [both + seed CSV]

The first four answer "what does the PRODUCER get". `comm` answers a different,
standalone question — "what does the AGENCY earn" — and deliberately does NOT
re-rank or replace them.

THE PER-ACRE FORMULA (producer side)

    $/acre = best_net  x  CBV  x  coverage_level  x  productivity_factor

`best_net` is stored normalized per $1 of annual protection, and PRF protection
per acre is CBV x coverage level x productivity factor, so the product is the
average net return on one acre. Productivity factor is the grower's own election
(RMA allows 60%-150%); it is a page input, defaulting to 100%, and is applied
client-side at display time. Nothing is invented: a county needs BOTH a CBV and
a swept grid for the current selection, or it stays neutral.

THE COMMISSION FORMULA (agency side)

    protection/acre = CBV x coverage_level x productivity_factor
    premium/acre    = protection/acre x SUM(allocation_i x rate_i)
    commission/acre = premium/acre x commission_pct / 100

Agent commission is a percent of TOTAL premium — the subsidised portion included.
Premium is the County Base Value scaled by a PREMIUM RATE, and it is the rate the
CBV view leaves out: across RY2026 Grazing @ 90% the allocation-weighted rate runs
0.068 to 0.493, a 7.3x spread, so the same CBV buys very different premium
depending on the grid. That is the point of the metric — the two rankings are
correlated (~0.80 on real data) but not the same list: only 10 of the top 25
counties by CBV are also in the top 25 by commission per acre, and the single
best commission county carries less than half the top CBV. A big-CBV county is
not automatically a big-commission county.

    SUM(allocation_i x rate_i) is precomputed and STORED, not derived here.
    prf_grid_rate (2.1M rows) is dropped from the shipped app DB, so the
    allocation-weighted rate for each stored winner lives on the prf_opt_best row
    as best_net_rate_sum / best_win_rate_sum (written natively by
    src/prfsweep.compute_grid_best, and by scripts/backfill_rate_sums.py for rows
    predating those columns). The page does only the cheap multiplication.

The allocation used is the BEST-NET one — the optimizer's recommended policy —
so the number means "what I earn if the producer buys what the map recommends",
NOT the maximum premium an allocation could be made to generate.

commission_pct itself is HAND-MAINTAINED in data/seed/aip_commission.csv: it is
negotiated between AIP and agency and published nowhere, so it cannot be derived.
Every rate ships blank; the metric degrades to an honest "no rates set" note
rather than assuming a number.

THE USE AXIS (why one control drives two datasets)

prf_county is keyed by (intended_use, irrigation_practice); prf_opt_best is keyed
by a single intended_use whose values already encode irrigation. They line up
exactly, and this module derives the shared key rather than hardcoding it:

    prf_county(Grazing, Non-Irrigated)  ->  "Grazing"
    prf_county(Haying,  Non-Irrigated)  ->  "Haying"
    prf_county(Haying,  Irrigated)      ->  "Haying-Irrigated"

i.e. key = intended_use, suffixed "-Irrigated" when the practice is irrigated —
which is precisely the optimizer's own naming. A practice combination the map
has never seen (say Grazing/Irrigated) would therefore surface as its own key
instead of being silently dropped.

AGGREGATION RULE (optimizer metrics): a county can touch several grids. For each
county x use x coverage the county takes the BEST value among its grids
INDEPENDENTLY per metric (max best_win_rate; max best_net — the winning grid may
differ). The tooltip keeps the per-grid detail.

Rendering mirrors src/webmap.py's zero-network approach: d3 v7, topojson-client
and the us-atlas counties-10m topology are embedded inline; every control lives
INSIDE the embedded HTML and re-shades client-side. Degrades gracefully — an
empty prf_county, an empty prf_opt_best, or a missing prf_grid_county mapping
each produce a valid map with an honest note rather than an error.

    the commission on the policy the map is recommending, not a mix of grids. Its sibling
    column best_win_rate_sum stays in the DB but is deliberately NOT embedded: no metric
    reads it, and another number on ~195k rows is ~1.5 MB of payload for nothing.

    plus axes (uses / coverages), county display names, per-metric min/max over
    every aggregated county value (the color-scale domains), and row counts so
    the client can distinguish "sweep not run" from "no grid->county mapping".

    WHY THE INDIRECTION: a grid touches ~2.3 counties, so inlining each grid's
    detail under every county it serves duplicated the whole sweep ~2.3x — the
    embedded payload came to 158 MB, which is not something a browser should be
    asked to parse inside an iframe. Grid details are therefore stored ONCE and
    referenced by index, and the winning allocations (interval codes + percent
    splits) are interned into `policies` because a few thousand distinct
    allocations are shared across ~200k rows. Same information, ~8x smaller.

    prf_opt_best.intended_use already uses the shared key vocabulary
    ('Haying-Irrigated'), so no remapping is needed here.

    <b>Return per acre</b> =
    <code>best net (per $1 of protection) &times; County Base Value ($/acre) &times; coverage level &times; productivity factor</code>.
    PRF protection per acre is CBV &times; coverage level &times; productivity factor, so this is the
    average net return on one acre. Productivity factor is the grower's election (RMA allows
    60–150%); a county needs BOTH a CBV and a swept grid for the current selection or it stays neutral.
  </div>
  <div class="fn" data-m="comm">
    <b>Commission per acre</b> =
    <code>County Base Value ($/acre) &times; coverage level &times; productivity factor &times; &Sigma;(allocation &times; premium rate) &times; commission %</code>.
    Agent commission is a percent of <b>total</b> premium (the subsidised portion included), and
    premium is the County Base Value scaled by the <b>premium rate</b> — which the CBV view leaves
    out entirely and which varies several-fold between grids at the same coverage. So the
    biggest-CBV counties are not the biggest-commission counties: a mid-CBV county on an expensive
    grid outearns a top-CBV county on a cheap one. The allocation priced is the optimizer's
    <b>recommended</b> (best-net) policy, so this is what you earn if the producer buys what this
    map recommends — not a maximum-premium figure.
    Commission % is your own negotiated rate, hand-entered in
    <code>data/seed/aip_commission.csv</code> as an <b>AIP &times; region</b> table &mdash; rates
    differ by region within one AIP and between AIPs, and the same rate recurs across AIPs, so a
    single number per AIP cannot express them (and would make this map an exact rescale of
    premium). Region is the county's time zone, assigned per state. It is published nowhere and
    cannot be derived. <b>The rates shipped in that file are SAMPLE data</b> &mdash; replace them
    with your own before quoting any figure here.
  </div>
  <div class="fn" data-m="win">
    Intended use does not move this metric. A PRF premium rate is a function of the grid's
    rainfall distribution, the interval and the coverage level — not of what the forage is used
    for — so for effectively every grid this number is identical across Grazing, Haying and
    Haying-Irrigated. Switching use changes <b>which grids are rated</b> (Haying is offered on
    fewer), so the shaded set moves even when the values do not. Use drives the County Base Value
    and therefore the two per-acre metrics.
